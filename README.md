# PNW.foliar-traits.C-storage
#this project was created by Colin Averill on January 19, 2016. 
#The goal is to relate foliar leaf traits, weighted by basal area, to soil C and N storage in co-located areas.
#data were accessed on January 19, 2016 from ORNL DAAC: https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1292

#overall goals:
#1. Get a basal area weighted leaf chemistry for each plot, which includes leaf %C, %N, C:N and SLA. 
#2. Calculate soil C and N storage, as well as bulk density weighted %clay and pH for each site. 
#3. Classify tree composition as AM/EM, get a basal area weighted metric of %EM (0-100%)
#4. Analyze soil C and N storage as a function of basal area weighted leaf traits and mycorrhizal associations.
