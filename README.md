# PNW.foliar-traits.C-storage
this project was created by Colin Averill on January 19, 2016. 
the goal is to relate foliar leaf traits, weighted by basal area, to soil C and N storage in co-located areas.

#overall goals:
1. Get a basal area weighted leaf chemistry for each plot, which includes leaf %C, %N, C:N and SLA. 
- foliar C:N accomplished.
2. Calculate soil C and N storage, as well as bulk density weighted %clay and pH for each site.
- this is next step.
3. Classify tree composition as AM/EM, get a basal area weighted metric of %EM (0-100%)
- this requires modifying the file I have for the FIA. pretty straight forward.
4. Analyze soil C and N storage as a function of basal area weighted leaf traits and mycorrhizal associations.
- I cannot wait for this part.
